          <h2>What challenges did you encounter while creating the webpage?</h2>
          <p>
            I encountered quite a few challenges while working on this assignment. My biggest issue was not being able to use flexbox, grid or tables for the layout of the website, 
            I found it very difficult using float and position to layout a responsive web page. The section with the most difficult was the gallery section and speaker section. 
            At first, I found it near impossible to get the pictures and text to line up properly. It wasn't until we came back to class from reading week when we learned about columns 
            in css that I was able to figure out how to get it to line up properly. 
          </p>
          <h2>How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging any issues?</h2>
          <p>
            Another challenge I faced was the troubleshooting. I would look over our lectures and past labs to find some answers, 
            but another issue was when I would try to google solutions for my problem. Whenever I would look into solutions, they almost always included flexbox so I had to spend a little more
            time looking through search results to find a solution that could help me achieve what I wanted. Overall, a lot of my problems were solved once we came back to class after 
            reading week with the lecture on positioning.
          </p>
          <h2>What did you learn about positioning and layouts in web development?</h2>
          <p>
            I learned a lot about positioning and layouts throughout working on this assignment, including using relative units such as percentages, REM or VH/VW 
            instead of pixels as way to build a responsive page. I also found that I would design the layout for a specific section but would
            find myself finding a new and better solution, but that made some of my old code pointless so it's important to know exactly what each line of code is doing
            so that if you make changes, you can go back and look and say oh this line isn't necessary so let me get rid of this extra code.
